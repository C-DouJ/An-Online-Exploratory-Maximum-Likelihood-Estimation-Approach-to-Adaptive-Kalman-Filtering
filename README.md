# An-Online-Exploratory-Maximum-Likelihood-Estimation-Approach-to-Adaptive-Kalman-Filtering
This repository provides four **online exploratory maximum likelihood-based adaptive Kalman filters**, which feature **fast convergence** and **high estimation accuracy**.  
Each algorithm has its own characteristics, making it suitable for different application scenarios (corresponding to the paper “An Online Exploratory Maximum Likelihood Estimation Approach to Adaptive Kalman Filtering”).
